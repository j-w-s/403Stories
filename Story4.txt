Amidst the chaos of life, he found solace in a sea of goldfish crackers. As he murdered (munched on) the cheesy goldfish crackers, he found himself reminiscing about his childhood. The simple pleasure of the crunchy snacks transported him back to a time when life was less complicated, less chaotic. He remembered laughing with his friends, their faces smeared with the orange dust of the goldfish crackers. He smiled, feeling a sense of peace washing over him.
THE GOLDFISH WASNT A GOLDFISH. IT WAS A FISH MADE OF GOLD.
Goldbert the greed, the fish manifestation of the greed of all man.
The end of times
The end of the world
The end of life
